							<h2>Preseason Power Rankings</h2>
							<h3>I'm Awake Now</h3>
						</header>

						<ol type="1">
							<li>Isaac (-):  Isaac had yet another masterful draft, putting together a squad that is strong top to bottom.  The team is led by the notorious anthem stander Drew Brees at QB, with young superstars Arob and Calvin Ridley starting at WR.  Derrick Henry and Aaron Jones are two big bruisers who will punch in countless 3 yard touchdowns this year.  Tyler Higbee was the steal of the draft, with an ADP of round 6, who Isaac acquired in round 23.  To round out this perfection of a draft, Isaac has countless above average players to occupy the two flex spots.  The only downside to Isaac’s draft is the fact he can’t field a team week 6 or 11; however, he’ll have traded half his team by then or the season will be cancelled due to rona so it’s a NON ISSUE.</li><br />
							<li>Guff (-):  Despite having third world country internet more unreliable than himself, Guff managed to put together a solid draft after teaming up with autodraft.  Lamar Jackson will be a top 2 QB, with Michael Thomas probably being the top overall WR.  OBJ will cause Guff more headaches than punctuality, but the 2 games a year he goes off will make it all seem worth it (even though it won’t be.)  With solid RBs and enough TEs to make Ben jealous, Guff looks to be a force to be reckoned with this year.</li><br />
							<li>Debellis (-):  Darkhorse Debellis had a sneaky great draft.  His starting lineup is fantastic, although his bench could use a little work.  Zeke and Eke(ler) are a dynamic RB duo, while Chris “the” God(win) is possibly the best WR to ever exist.  As long as his team stays injury free, and he doesn’t need to lean on Zack Moss and Darius Slayton to carry him to victory, Debellis should be dancing to Eastside all season long.</li><br />
							<li>Ben (-):  Ben prioritized golfing and not dying while driving on the turnpike over his fantasy draft, and it shows.  There are no WRs more renowned for their certain let downs than Will Fuller V and Brandin Cooks, a duo who will definitely kill his VIBES.  Additionally, his flex RBs are on two of the worst teams in the NFL, which at any point in time are usually losing by 35 points and airing it out.  Despite all this, Ben’s draft was saved by the weekly 80 points he’ll get from Pat Mahomes and Saquon and his inevitable return to the 2 TE lineup.</li><br />
							<li>Matt (-):  Current Terd Matt took full advantage of being carried by the D2 All Stars and parlaying his 5th overall pick into a shockingly competent draft.  Dak Prescott was a trash pick up at QB and likely only picked up for the Dak / Gallup double points, but there are enough QBs to go around that that can be overlooked.  Julio and Kamara are superstars, while James Connor will provide solid output for the 4 games he’s not injured or departing early due to injury.  On his bench, Matt has enough lottery tickets that one should pay off and be able to replace Gurley once his knee explodes on his third carry.</li><br />
							<li>Dac (-):  While Dac secured the top fantasy player of 2020 (CMC), that’s about all he did with his draft.  CMC is good enough to single handedly win Dac games this year, but the rest of his team is going to make that job harder than it needs to be.  His second best RB is often injured, contract disputing, new team, no oxygen in Denver, Mr. timesharing Melvin Gordon.  Travis Kelce, DHop, and Russell Wilson are a strong enough ensemble to keep Dac as a dark horse to just sneak into the playoffs, which is a far cry from his 2019 first place finish.</li><br />
							<li>Donch (-):  Donch put together a pure value team.  No flashy superstars, no total duds, just a bunch of solid blue collar hustlers.  Half of his team even have blue collar names.  Carson, Kenny, David, Chris, Bob, Tyler, Matt, and John.  Is this a fantasy football team or an electricians’ union?  Donch’s entire team is a 7/10, which is very fitting for the power ranking of 7th best draft out of 10.</li><br />
							<li> Danny (-):  Danny has smashed all expectations by not having the worst draft.  His starting position players are actually all average to slightly above average, with Penn State great Miles Sanders leading the pack.  Danny’s troubles will be in filling his two flex spots, where his 7th through 14th best players have no discernable separation.  Having to choose the best 2 out of 8 identical players is a task too tall for even the shrewdest of fantasy managers, let alone for perennial RST and owner of the league's worst record and lowest score ever.</li><br />
							<li>Davies (-):  At first glance, Davies’ team looks pretty solid.  Upon further analysis, the weaknesses start to appear.  His team is composed almost entirely of has-beens, inconsistent players, and high risk players (both due to injury and suspensions from beating women and children.)  Davies will surely struggle starting the correct QB between Matty Ice and Arod, while Mike Evans will have enough good weeks to help Davies safely reach 5 wins.  Who knows if AJ Green ever healed from 2018, and Dalvin Cook will surely have a season ending injury, forcing Davies to rely entirely on Jonathan Taylor Thomas and JnJ at RB.</li><br />
							<li> JC (-):  JC’s team is not great.  His RB duo is led by the Budweiser Clydesdale and Joe Mediocre Mixon.  His team is not flashy, and he doesn’t have any superstars.  None of this will matter in the slightest in 3 weeks because the waiver wire is JC’s bread and butter, not this garbage drafting business.  He’ll stitch together a lovely team and be in the top 4 a third of the way through the season.  At this point, JC is just keeping the 10 spot warm for Danny.</li><br />
