							<h2>WEEK 2 POWER RANKINGS</h2>
							<h3>“The Truest Definition of GARBAGE”</h3>
						</header>

						<ol type="1">
							<li>Debellis (-): Debellis has strung together two solid weeks to remain atop the power rankings.  At first glance, his squad doesn’t seem intimidating at all, but for whatever reason, they all put up 15-20 points a week.  The only misstep Debellis had this week was due to the injury of Chris Godwin, who Debellis replaced with Anthony Miller, scoring 0 points to honor Godwin absence. </li><br />
							<li>Isaac (+2):  The good news is Isaac had the top WR, RB, and TE scores of week 2.  The bad news is that even with that, Isaac didn’t even have the high score of the week.  If Isaac had any semblance of competent QB play and defense, he could’ve surpassed the league historical high score, and at worst, had the high score for the week.  Those two underperforming positions were promptly cut.  Hopefully Derrick Henry and Arob are watching.</li><br />
							<li>Donch (-1):  Donch had one of the most unbelievable comebacks this week as he secured a victory by a fraction of a point with the epitome of garbage time catches.  The Saints had no business running plays, but that didn’t stop Jared Cook from hauling in the crappiest of 6 yard receptions in the middle of the field to keep Donch’s undefeated season alive.  Donch will either score the most points of the week or rip your heart out at the last second.  Only Donch’s team blue collar hustle squad knows the value of playing until the final whistle.</li><br />
							<li>Dac (+2):  Dac’s team is just really good top to bottom.  He’s the top scorer in the league, and for perspective, has outscored Ben by 125 points in just two weeks. It is not unreasonable to think he could end up with the top player at 4 different positions.  However, before we crown Dac the repeat champ, he must first navigate a situation common to the peons below him, playing each week without an RB guaranteed to score >20 points.</li><br />
							<li>Davies (+2):  Davies won the battle of the worst managers in a shootout.  He not only left 37 QB points on his bench (again), he also left KHunt and Smith’s 23 points apiece on the bench as well.  Davies’ 150 pt week showed he can play with the big boys, but now with Mostert out, it will be exciting to see which wrong player he slots in his place this week.</li><br />
							<li>JC (-3):  JC came out firing this week, led again by another impressive Josh Allen performance.  Unfortunately for JC, his star QB got one upped by a super star QB and was victim of the same result at almost every other position.  There are worse things than being 1-1 with the only loss being to the eventual repeat champ, like being any of the guys below cemented in the dumps.</li><br />
							<li>Matt (-2):  Matt had an above average week, but unfortunately came face to face with a once in a lifetime offensive performance by Isaac’s team.  James Connor somehow managed to not get hurt this week and scored a cool 20, while Kamara had about 27 dump off catches which he converted for almost 34 points.  At least Matt has completely average QB (and RB1) Dak Prescott to rely on next week as he faces another top 3 opponent.</li><br />
							<li>Danny (+1):  Danny extended his winless streak deeper into 2020.  Danny truly showed the extent of his winless abilities in the stupid manager bowl after paying $32 for N. Hines to score 1.7 points in the flex.  If Danny would’ve flipped a coin, he would’ve had a better chance of randomly selecting a player from his bench and ultimately winning a game.  The odds of Danny scoring this many points again are slim, so a repeat 0-13 is well within reach.</li><br />
							<li>Guff (-1):  This week couldn’t have gone worse for Guff.  He’s 2/2 in playing the wrong TE, he lost in heartbreaking fashion to the ultimate garbage catch, he spent $81 waiver bucks on a guy who scored negative points, he’s 0-2, and OBJ had a good enough game that Guff can’t reasonably bench him for at least 4 weeks.</li><br />
							<li>Ben (-):  Just when you thought Ben’s team couldn’t possibly get worse after week 1, HE TOTALLY REDEEMS HIMSELF.  Ben started not one, but TWO players who failed to score a single fraction of a point.  Not even a catch for -5 yards to get an active 0.  Those two guys just didn’t even touch a football from the start to the end of the game.  If that wasn’t enough, Ben’s first round draft pick is now out for the season.  Things haven’t looked this dire for Ben since he was held hostage in his own house by a teenager.   </li><br />
