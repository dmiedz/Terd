							<h2>WEEK 1 POWER RANKINGS</h2>
							<h3>“We’re in the sassy stage”</h3>
						</header>

						<ol type="1">
							<li>Debellis (+2): Sneaky darkhorse Debellis didn’t stay a sneaky darkhorse for long.  His team came out guns blazin’ as he put up an impressive 145.50 pts, which was just enough to beat a monster week from his opponent, Dac the defending champ.  Almost all of his players scored double digits, even his bench.  The top spot is Debellis’ to lose, as he stands ready to stomp on all who dare venture to the Eastside.</li><br />
							<li>Donch (+5): Mr. Value City himself put up the top score of the week on the backs of his blue collar hustle squad.  Ben, Bob, and David all had great games.  However, the real standout was Davante Adams Fountaine who chipped in with 35.6 points.  Donch’s opponent even had a respectable week, which makes his 26 pt victory even more impressive.  The future is bright for Donch, as after week 1, the D1 bye already looks to be his.</li><br />
							<li>JC (+7):  As predicted, JC’s tenure in last was short lived; however, the speed of his rise was quicker than expected.  The week started strong for JC with Clydesdale impressing everyone with his debut, and QB/RB1 Josh Allen continuing the positive momentum early Sunday.  JC had enough firepower with Thielen and Metcalf to put le Guff down early, but he will need to work his waiver wire magic this season if he expects to do anything of value with Joe Mixon, Massachusetts Scott, and Tarik Cohen rounding out his stable of RBs.      </li><br />
							<li>Isaac (-3):  Isaac limped to victory this week, barely beating perennial RST Danny.  Calvin Ridley was Isaac’s lone shining star, single handedly keeping him in the game until Derrick Henry could add the finishing blows in the wee hours of the morning. If his team, (apart from Ridley), could figure out how to score touchdowns, and he got a defense that didn’t score negative points, Isaac could be a force to be reckoned with this year aka sneaking into the playoffs with a losing record.</li><br />
							<li>Matt (-):  The terdman faced the future terdman this week and had a completely pedestrian performance while also taking home the biggest blowout.  Matt had some amazing individual performances this week, with the only downside being half of them were on his bench.  Making the smart roster decisions should be easier this week though, as Matt will need his lottery ticket picks to pay off to replace Marlon Mack, who is done for the year, and James Connor, who to the surprise of no one, got injured his first (but certainly not last) game of the year.</li><br />
							<li>Dac (-):  It was a roller coaster Monday for Dac, as he bounced between favorite and underdog with each subsequent series.  Ultimately, he came up fractions of a point away from victory at the end, thanks to bone head Broncos coaching.  He had the third highest score of the week, and unfortunately ran into 1 of the 2 opponents who could beat him. Despite the heartbreak this week, Dac looks to have a solid squad, and just like Yung Dicky’s head circumference, won’t come up short.  </li><br />
							<li>Davies (+2):  By most(ert) accounts, Davies had a fine week.  He can’t complain about a 28 pt QB performance, even when the back up drops 39 pts on the bench.  His starting RBs combined for 46.4 points, which was far and away the best duo this week in the league.  If it’s any consolation for Davies, there’s nothing he could’ve done differently to win this week, and he still gets to face Danny twice.</li><br />
							<li>Guff (-6):  Lamar Jackson was as advertised, and Josh Jacobs exceeded every possible expectation, but the rest of his team leaves a lot to be desired.  He left automatic TD TE TJ on the bench, and he lost two starters to injury.  On top of all that, he gets to understand what Isaac dealt with all last year with the king of the craptastic browns, OBJ.  Guff’s team is like OBJ’s ideal night - ça pue.</li><br />
							<li>Danny (-1):  Danny surprised no one by losing his first game of the season.  In fact, 2018 was the last time Danny won a regular season game.  That might as well have been 100 years ago.  It’s going to be a long season for Danny, as he’s already lost a third of his team to injury.  The good news is, if anyone knows what it takes to go 0-13, it’s Danny.</li><br />
							<li>Ben (-6):  Ben’s team is a complete catastrophe.  He managed to make good players bad and bad players worse.  Will Fuller was the only player out of 15 roster spots to exceed projections.  This dumpster fire is 2020 personified as a fantasy football squad.  Ben will definitely need to shake things up, possibly with a vibrator, if he wants even the slightest chance to lose again in the championship this year.  </li><br />
