							<h2>WEEK 9 POWER RANKINGS</h2>
							<h3>We already got that bro</h3>
						</header>

						<ol type="1">
							<li>Dac (+1):  Dac got his free Ben win this week, winning by 60 points.  It was the return of CMC this week, who contributed 32 points to Dac’s total.  The return was short lived, as CMC got injured and is out an undetermined amount of time.  It won’t matter, as Dac was still one of the best teams even over the 6 week stretch without CMC.  Apart from JC, no one should be as confident in their playoff spot as Dac. </li><br />
							<li>JC (+1):  JC finally got the monster game out of Josh Allen that he’s been looking for for the past 5 weeks.  He also got superstar performances again from DK Metcalf and AJ Brown, which was clutch because the rest of his team stank.  His RBs combined for 4 points, his TE <1, his super star WR duo of Thielen and Michael Thomas combined for barely over a dozen, and the Chicago D chipped in another 4.  JC would’ve been in big trouble if this happened a few weeks ago during HOT DANNY’s prime, but thankfully for JC, Danny has gone back to his RST roots where 104 point victories are still a thing.</li><br />
							<li>Isaac (+1):  Christmas must’ve come early because Isaac got a gift of a victory this week.  Failing to break 100 for the 2nd straight week, Isaac somehow managed to still win by 30 points.  Just to put this horrific performance in perspective, Evan Engram was Isaac’s best non-QB with 13 points, outscoring stars like Lockett, Arob, Henry, and AJones in the process.  Isaac is currently failing upwards and has a chance to repeat an undeserved win against Guff’s hot and cold team.</li><br />
							<li>Debellis (-3):  After last week’s completely undeserved sub 100 point win, Debellis got a little karma as he posted the 3rd highest score of the week (his 2nd highest of the season) and got completely blown out by Davies.  In fantasy football, you win some and you lose some, and Debellis has already won more than he deserved, so no pity.</li><br />
							<li>Davies (+1):  Davies’ bipolar team was back in action this week, scoring 173 points against previously top ranked Debellis.  In the short span of 4 weeks, Davies has scored 62 points and 173.  There’s no telling what you’ll get on a week to week basis with Davies’ team, but as long as Dalvin Cook is the best RB of all time, he’s got a shot to win every week. </li><br />
							<li>Matt (-1):  Matt went back to his Terdy ways this week, posting the low weekly score.  Not a single starter on Matt’s team managed to exceed projections.  Bench included, only Matt Ryan did, who Matt in his infinite terdiness left on his bench in exchange for Matt Stafford’s 10 points.  Matt’s team will likely bounce back, but this loss puts him closer to the dumps than any former Terd is comfortable being.</li><br />
							<li>Donch (-):  Donch had a heartbreaking and improbable loss this week, thanks to a complete meltdown by Tom Brady and the Bucs.  A respectable but not greedy 22 QB points is all Donch needed to bolster his late season run to the playoffs and to all but doom Guff to the dumps.  Instead, Donch is now looking at an uphill battle to avoid a permanent return to the dumps.</li><br />
							<li>Guff (+1):  Guff currently looks like a genius on his 2 game win streak after sniping Pat Mahomes from Ben.  It is 100% fact that without Ben sending over his 2 best players to Guff, Guff would be 1-8 instead of Ben.  Mahomes followed up last week’s 47 point performance with 39 points this week, as that QB performance was the difference between victory and defeat.</li><br />
							<li>Danny (-1):  It would appear that HOT DANNY was a flash in the pan and not the sign of bigger things to come.  Fresh off the back of a 3 game win streak, Danny has now gone 0-2 the past 2 weeks, averaging 86 points in the process.  The longest of shots for playoffs, Danny can at least take solace in the fact that he’ll relinquish his RST crown this year.</li><br />
							<li>Ben (-):  Ben got a miraculous 32 points out of his trade gems Lamar Jackson and Josh Jacobs, which is 6 points less than Pat Mahomes alone got and 27 points less than Mahomes and Fuller.  Ben’s team is bad and there is no hope for it to get better.  Dac’s 4 best players would’ve beat Ben by 14.  At this point, it’s debatable whether Ben could possibly even get lucky enough to win a fluke game in the Terdgler Bowl.</li><br />
