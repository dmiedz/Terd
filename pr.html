							<h2>WEEK 13 POWER RANKINGS</h2>
							<h3>Knock down your tiny walls</h3>
						</header>

						<ol type="1">
							<li>Davies (+2):  Davies finds himself at the top of the power rankings for the first and most important time this season.  After a year of flip flopping between 170 and 70 point weeks, the stars aligned for Davies as his mediocre week was more than enough to doom Guff to the dumps and JC fell to Danny.  While Davies certainly has the scariest team in the postseason, he also has the team that has the lowest score of the year in a league with Ben and Danny.</li><br />
							<li>Isaac (-):  Isaac controlled his own destiny this week, with a win securing him the D2 bye.  Under all that pressure, Isaac achieved his goal of the D2 bye, however, it was by the most unlikely and undeserved of circumstances.  Isaac put up his worst week of the year, getting absolutely obliterated by Donch.  Isaac had one player beat projections, and that was only due to a garbage time 77 yard TD rush.  Despite this incompetence, the efforts of Isaac’s peers also battling for the D2 bye proved similarly futile, as their respective losses allowed Isaac to fall bass ackwards into D2 royalty.</li><br />
							<li>Dac (-2):  Dac suffered a humiliating loss this week to the RST which ended his hopes of the much deserved D2 bye.  Dac was the only team in D2 that didn’t score below 100 in any week, with JC being the only other team in the league who can say the same.  It was still a respectable 120 point week, even with A. Gibson’s injury forcing him out of the game with only 14 yards.  Despite objectively having the best team in D2, Dac did not play the game right and sacrifice everything for those division wins.</li><br />
							<li>JC (-):  After being at the top of the D1 standings for most of the year, JC was victim to a major upset at the hands of perennial fantasy farce Danny.  A win would’ve secured the D1 bye, but JC’s reluctance to trade his bench warmer Jamaal Williams for a serviceable TE named Robert Tonyan proved to be the difference.  J. Akins scored 2 pts compared to Tonyan’s 12, and JC lost by 8 points.  This declined trade may turn out to be irrelevant if JC can beat his partner in crime, Debellis, in the first round of the playoffs, or it may be his biggest regret since following Griff to GN Centre and somehow getting involved with this gang of fools.</li><br />
							<li>Debellis (-):  Debellis came up just short this week and lost to Matt on Tuesday night football.  Heading into Tuesday, the D2 bye was well within grasp for Debellis, a position he’d been in for most of the year.  Instead, Debellis choked and now sits in the 5 seed with a tough matchup against D1’s Mr. Consistent JC.  Regardless of what happens this week, Debellis has shown strength and resilience, making playoffs in each of his 2 years so far in the league.  That 2 year streak is something Danny has been unable to achieve in a decade.</li><br />
							<li>Donch (+1):  Donch had to win this week and get some help to make the playoffs.  Donch was not even fazed as he put up his second consecutive 143.10 point week.  Weird.  Anyway, with 7 out of 9 positions exceeding expectations, Donch scorched Isaac by 56 points and was only a meaningless Aaron Jones 77 yard TD rush from taking home the season’s biggest blowout as well.  As the only playoff contender with a losing record, Donch will certainly become the people’s favorite.</li><br />
							<li>Guff (-1):  In the most important game of the season, Guff pulled a Ben by scoring sub-80 in a must win game.  On the back of a 5 game win streak, Guff only had to make it 6 to pull off the most improbable streak of all time to make playoffs.  But alas, it would not be.  Pat Mahomes only had 21 points, while Guff had the worst RB duo of the year, combining Ben Snell Jr.’s 2 points with CEH’s active (but not active) goose egg.  Guff is definitely the favorite in the dumps, but his lack of experience could prove costly.</li><br />
							<li>Matt (-1):  Matt’s team makes absolutely no sense and his gross mismanagement of them over the past 6 weeks is the reason Matt has a very real chance to be repeat terd.  After a 4 game losing streak, Matt finally stopped the bleeding and played spoiler for Debellis and hero for Isaac, a gift Isaac was unable to return in his matchup vs. Donch.  Matt has enough firepower on paper that he should be able to take down Danny or Ben and avoid repeat Terdom, but his QB picking abilities provide enough downside that Matt may go where no man has ever gone before and actually become a repeat Terd.</li><br />
							<li>Danny (-):  Danny was the architect of one of the biggest upsets of the year, which is hardly surprising because any Danny victory represents a huge upset.  Danny’s team is very bad, but a 44 point Darren Waller performance was more than enough to offset the Eagles hating Miles Sanders and Frank Gore getting mushy brained on his first carry.  The true unsung hero on Danny’s team this week was Cole Beasley, who now has been passed around more than Guff at a barber shop.</li><br />
							<li>Ben (-):  Ben had his best week of the year, which granted is not a high bar, en route to his victory of D2 juggernaut Dac.  This week was extrodinarily meaningless for Ben as neither a win or a loss would change his fate of locking in his first RST; however, it should be known that his performance was very much appreciated.  Despite this abomination of a season from Ben, he did at least not leave empty handed.  Ben will take home enough winnings from the week 13 high score that he could fund 1 month of spotify premium or a naked ASMRer’s onlyfans.</li><br />
