							<h2>PRESEASON POWER RANKINGS</h2>
							<h3>#BULLPOWER</h3>
						</header>

						<ol type="1">
							<li>Isaac (-):  Isaac managed to parlay drafting 8th into the draft of the night.  After having been burned by every early round RB he’s ever drafted (AP beating children, Trent Richardson forgetting how to play football, cotton candy legs CMC, etc.), Isaac instead snagged 2 of the top 5 WRs with his first 2 picks and followed that up by grabbing the top QB.  With the rest of his draft, he secured unparalleled depth, with enough handcuffs to all but ensure multiple back half RB1s via starter injury and attrition.</li><br />
							<li>Davies (-):  Davies’ incredible draft this year was all the more impressive given the fact he likely did 0 research on account of having sired a small village this year.  His team is the perfect mix of fantasy studs and reliable contributors with big upside.  A strong fantasy season is of utmost importance for Davies to enjoy the NFL this year, as rooting for his hometown Browns will be a morally dubious endeavor.</li><br />
							<li>Guff (-):  Guff put together a strong draft despite drafting in the middle of the night.  Granted, taking tight ends back to back in the 4th and 5th round was questionable, but Guff has a well rounded team which should help him avoid a three peat terd bowl appearance.  As the rookie WR whisperer, Guff increased his odds of hitting a home run by drafting three, although Jahan Dotson is the only one whose success the league will encourage.</li><br />
							<li>Dac (-):  Dac had a solid draft, but it was always going to be a drop off from his ungodly 2021 championship team.  Dac drafted perennial headache Tyler Lockett and missed out on his favorite handcuff Mattison.  While Dac is a lock for playoffs, a repeat championship seems ambitious at best.</li><br />
							<li>Donch (-):  Donch wasted no time taking JT first in the draft.  It was a no brainer, and JT will single handedly win Donch more than a couple games.  Speaking of no brains, Donch also drafted QBs back to back in the 12th and 13th rounds.  While not the strongest team in the draft, Donch should have no problems finding himself in the playoffs again this year. </li><br />
							<li>Ben (-):  Whether a self-fulfilling prophecy or the ultimate manifestation of the terd curse, nobody has so completely exemplified what it means to be Terd more than Ben.  STDs and therapists are logical and predictable consequences of terd life, but Ben’s speed run to the bottom was something to behold.  However, with a strong draft and some 2015 flashbacks, Ben looks poised to turn his fortune around.  For Ben’s sake, let’s hope the famous quote by Lao Tzu, “the terd that burns twice as bright burns half as long,” rings true.</li><br />
							<li>JC (-):  JC will start the season 3-0 with a combined 100 points from CMC.  After that, he will fight to stay at .500 once all of CMC’s muscles fall off the bone like BBQ ribs.  If (and when) AJ Dillon supplants Aaron Jones for the starting job in Green Bay, JC could reasonably find himself in his first terd bowl.  In the off chance the fantasy gods smile favorably upon JC and the aforementioned events don’t occur, JC will steamroll the joke of a division D1 like always.</li><br />
							<li>Matt (-):  Matt had some interesting draft strategies this year, such as drafting 3 Cowboys and drafting 2 Saints that may combine for a full season.  He’s got some hope at WR, but it could be a long year at the RB position.  Barring a miracle, Matt’s most likely result this year is a repeat of his 2021 Toilet Bowl victory.</li><br />
							<li>Debellis (-):  Debellis finds himself with the 2nd worst draft this year on account of drafting all the guys nobody wanted who were just sitting there for 4 rounds.  With the 47th overall pick, he took the famous tik toker Breece Hall.  Debellis’ team looks like the Great Value line up of NFL players.  Breece Hall? Tyler Allgeier? Nico Collins?  Who are these guys, and why did Debellis draft so many players for the league’s worst teams?  Half of Debellis’ roster plays for powerhouse teams like the Jets, Lions, Seahawks, Falcons, and Texans.  At the end of this year, Debellis will be praying for his standard 7-7 season.</li><br />
							<li>Danny (-):  Danny won this year’s best draft award which means he has absolutely no chance of making the playoffs.  Even had he not won the cursed draft award, he would have absolutely no chance of making the playoffs anyway because he is a horrible fantasy manager.  Despite everyone loving and rooting for Saquon, Danny is only inviting another year of pain and disappointment by drafting him, let alone in the 2nd round.  On top of that, Danny drafted the 2 most frustrating fantasy players of 2021, Josh Jacobs and DK Metcalf.  If there’s one person who doesn’t need an uphill battle to get out of the terd spot, it’s Danny.</li><br />
