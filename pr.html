							<h2>WEEK 12 POWER RANKINGS</h2>
							<h3>Did you get his number?</h3>
						</header>

						<ol type="1">
							<li>Dac (-):  In a match up critical towards achieving the D2 bye, Dac emerged victorious, taking down Debellis with room to breathe.  It wasn’t Dac’s finest week, but thankfully those aren’t often needed to best Debellis.  The real hero on Dac’s team this week was Antonio Gibson who scored 34 and the WFT defense who added another 21.  Despite Russell Wilson falling off dramatically and Dhop becoming invisible the past couple weeks, Dac is still the best D2 has to offer and has a legitimate shot to repeat.</li><br />
							<li>Isaac (-):  After his incredibly unlucky and fluke loss to Ben earlier in the season, Isaac meant business this week, crushing Ben by 50+ points.  Derrick Henry finally got to score all the touchdowns he deserved, as Jonnu Smith didn’t vulture any goal line carries and the Titans stopped passing from the 1.  Arob also lived up to expectations, scoring 2 TDs and 23 points while the Bears were getting completely blown out.  Isaac has the firepower to make a deep playoff run, depending on whether 52 point or 4 point Tyler Lockett shows up.  </li><br />
							<li> Davies (+1):  Davies picked up his 4th weekly high score this week in a high scoring 158 vs 143 victory over Donch.  Between Arod, Tyreek, and Dalvin Cook, Davies has 1-3 players who are essentially unlimited in the amount of points they can score in any given week.  This week it was Tyreek, who put up over 60 points, which was more than enough to cover Jonnu Smith’s big goose egg.</li><br />
							<li>JC (+1):  JC did what he had to this week to move one step closer to the D1 bye, easily beating Matt’s free falling team.  The bye is extremely important to JC, as his WRs are some of the best in the league, but his running back situation is below average to put it nicely, which would make JC an underdog in any first round playoff game.</li><br />
							<li>Debellis (-2):  In a must win game for the D2 bye, Debellis fell 13 points short.  Kyler Murray had his worst game of the year by far, as Ezekiel Elliot did the same.  Having clinched playoffs with the D2 bye being more or less out of reach, the best Debellis can hope for going forward is no injuries or Covid and a matchup against anyone other than Davies.</li><br />
							<li>Guff (-):  Guff now owns the longest active winning streak at 5 games as he’s come back from the dead thanks to Ben gifting him Patrick Mahomes.  After starting 1-6, Guff is now the odds on favorite to grab the final playoff spot after this week’s beat down of fantasy unextrodinar Danny.  Despite his current position, Guff will have to contend with furious attacks from Donch and Matt in week 13 as they both are within reaching distance of the playoffs; however, thanks to his experience at the barber, Guff should have no problem beating off all opponents.</li><br />
							<li>Donch (+1):  Donch needed a huge week to improve his odds at playoffs, and he got it.  The unfortunate thing is his opponent had an even more huge week.  Donch had an impressive 143 point week, even with 0 points from his defense.  Looking ahead, Donch has an uphill battle to make playoffs, and he’ll always look back to this week knowing if Tyreek only scored 45 points Donch might’ve avoided the dumps.</li><br />
							<li>Matt (-1):  Matt’s team is in complete shambles as he’s on a 4 game losing streak.  His QB stunk, he started a WR with 0 points, he started BRIAN HILL ON PURPOSE, and Kamara has been completely neutered by Taysom Hill doing whatever Taysom Hill does.  In a complete statistical impossibility, Matt managed to pick the worst QB in the NFL for the 27th consecutive week, this time brilliantly starting Derek Carr and his 0.6 points.  No one has sucked this much since Guff’s trip to the barber.</li><br />
							<li>Danny (-):  In a must win game for a chance to make playoffs, Danny did what everyone expected and lost by 30+ points.  Even a 41 point QB performance was not enough to make it respectable.  Despite being resigned to the dumps for the 18th consecutive year, Danny can take solace in the fact that he is much improved over last season, as numbers don’t even exist to quantify his percent improvement over last year’s regular season record.</li><br />
							<li>Ben (-):  Ben’s forgettable season continued this week, as he barely broke 100 and picked up his 9th loss.  David Montgomery was Ben’s best player, which makes no sense, until you realize that Ben’s entire team is trash cause he traded away all his best players.  Why would Ben have wanted 71 points from Mahomes and Fuller this week when he could get <4 from Josh Jacobs and have Rona Jackson sit on his bench?</li><br />
