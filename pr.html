							<h2>PRESEASON POWER RANKINGS</h2>
							<h3>1 star because lower isn’t a possibility...</h3>
						</header>

						<ol type="1">
							<li>Isaac (-):  Everyone can agree, Isaac had the undisputed best draft of the night.  This fact was even confirmed by Yahoo itself after awarding Isaac the ultra prestigious “Best Draft” award.  This can only mean one thing - there is a 0% chance Isaac makes the playoffs this year, similar to his odds of holding onto $100 for more than 7 seconds that was gifted to him by Ben.</li><br />
							<li>JC (-):  JC is typically just an average drafter, instead choosing to pwn n00bs throughout the season on the waiver wire.  However, JC easily had his best ever draft this year, which doesn’t bode well for the rest of the league.  The defending champ already starts each year a couple steps ahead by virtue of having fantasy football brain cells, but this year he’ll start out further ahead than a Sean Clifford overthrow.</li><br />
							<li>Matt (-):  It was just 9 months ago Matt received the brutal wake up call of almost becoming the first re-Terd.  Since then, he pulled himself up by his bootstraps and drafted a starting squad rivaling the quality of Stiletto’s Saturday night lineup.  Matt’s bench, on the other hand, is not promising and hopefully will be used less than his Visa gift card near smut subscriptions.</li><br />
							<li>Davies (-):  After having a great season last year, Davies decided to recreate the magic by drafting the same exact team, for better or worse.  His aspirations are higher than an Atlantic City strip club ATM’s fees.  With an impressive WR core and stud Chubb as leading RB, Davies does have the firepower to again be a playoff representative from the super top heavy and weak D1.</li><br />
							<li>Dac (-):  Dac started the draft very strongly with Dalvin Cook and Calvin Ridley, but things went downhill quickly as he picked up perennial let down Joe Mixon in the 3rd and Cooper Kupp in the 4th, a guy whose name is far too similar to Connor Culp.  Joe Mixon will definitely be culpable for Dac’s 5th place finish this year.  Dac’s draft is a solid 52/100, when a 53, or just one extra point, would’ve bumped him up a couple spots in the rankings.</li><br />
							<li>Ben (-):  Ben had a perfectly mediocre draft this year, getting a bunch of solid players but no one who will blow your socks off.  OBJ is a pick Ben will regret by week 4, BUT(t) PLUG in any of his serviceable back up WRs, and he’ll soon realize that they can be a gem.  Ben will need a strong start to this season this year after spending last year in the dumps and the BARE EXPOSURE of his true lack of fantasy football prowess.</li><br />
							<li>Debellis (-):  Debellis had yet another unremarkable draft and will plod his way to his 5th consecutive 8-7 season capping the year off with a victory in the Adam bowl.  Making the playoffs every year is nothing to sneeze at, but Debellis has shown that’s about his floor and ceiling when it comes to playing with the big boys.  However, Debellis will be the most exciting team this year as his lineup consists solely of boom or bust players.  It will be a treat to watch Debellis have 100 pt scoring swings week to week en route to his 5th place finish.</li><br />
							<li>Danny (-):  Eighth place is about the best Danny could’ve ever hoped for after drafting.  He is solidly out of Terdgler favorite territory based on draft outcome, but his complete fantasy ineptitude always keeps him in the running.  Danny has never been on the big stage, and this year won’t be the year he starts, but he does have a thing for choking people on the big stage.  </li><br />
							<li>Donch (-):  Donch had the most surprising pick of the draft, taking a tight end with the eighth pick.  He followed that bold pick up by loading up on Chargers and Jaguars, another bold strategy.  Donch’s only potential saving grace could be his lottery picks of Tyler Lockett and Michael Thomas.  Either of those guys could score 50+ pts a week, but they could also just as easily score 0.  Donch starts this season off in a big hole, but this king of grit and hustle might be able to grind his way to a 6th place finish.</li><br />
							<li>Guff (-):  This draft has proved that the Terd knows no bounds.  Neither time zones nor the expanse of the Atlantic Ocean can prevent the Terd from terding.  Mademoiselle Guff started the draft by reaching for an unproven rookie RB and capped it off fittingly with a 5’7” rookie WR.  According to Yahoo’s world leading AI and everyone who has ever watched football before, Guff’s draft day projection of 0-14 seems quite reasonable and should be an exciting journey to follow as he tries to become the first re-Terd.</li><br />
						</ol>

						<header>
							<h2>WEEK 1 POWER RANKINGS:</h2>
							<h3>That was a lot to coordinate via email</h3>
						</header>

						<ol type="1">
							<li>Isaac (-):  Isaac managed to parlay his best draft into the best score in the league this season.  The double tight end experiment couldn’t have gone better, as Waller and Hock combined for over 43 points.  A COVID free wedding, a honeymoon, and being the greatest fantasy football manager of all time - it won’t ever get better than this for Isaac.</li><br />
							<li>JC (-):  JC had a mediocre week by his standards, but it was more than enough to crush the complete joke of a team fielded by the terd.  Kyler Murray is the real deal, contributing 42 points while Compact Disc Lamb added another 20.  JC did mysteriously start Elijah Moore and his 0.2 points instead of literally any other football player not on the Jets, but maybe that was just a joke to rub in his inevitable victory against the terd.</li><br />
							<li> Matt (-):  Matt’s team had a fantastic week, with two of his players, Mahomes and Cooper, scoring over 30 points.  With the exception of Tonyan and Arob, his whole team was in double figures.  Matt’s team could be one to keep an eye on this year but only if he can avoid injuries, because while his starters are impressive, his bench has enough cuffs to make Adam jealous.</li><br />
							<li>Davies (-):  Davies managed to squeak out a victory against Donch this week on the back of his returning all star cast.  Tyreek Hill hasn’t missed a beat (insert assault and battery joke here) racking up 34 points.  Chubb added 21 and Davies’ fellow Penn State alumni Chris Godwin dropped 19 more.  Davies did make a blunder with his starting QB this week starting Herbert over Stafford, but he does have the LA QB scene on lockdown, which should prove to be a major asset through the rest of the year.</li><br />
							<li>Dac (-):  Dac had an impressive week thanks to some unexpected players.  Deebo Samuel and Joe Mixon were his two best players, combining for over 52 points.  Add that to 40 points from Cooper Kupp and Dalvin Cook and it was bound to be a solid week.  Dac still would’ve been competitive without almost all of the aforementioned players against Debellis’ league low score this week, but it never hurts to lock up the biggest blow out week 1.</li><br />
							<li>Donch (+3):  Donch came up just short this week but did prove that his team is much better than expected.  Reaching for Kelce in the first paid off, as he was the top TE of the week and should retain that status most weeks of the season.  Tyler Lockett is back to being the best WR ever; however, history has shown that surely can’t last.  Donch was just an untimely Mostert injury away from being top dawg in the division vs. teetering on the edge of the dumps.</li><br />
							<li>Ben (-1):  Ben got some great performances out of the team he hated himself for drafting.  In fact, Ben’s managerial skills contributed more to his loss this week than his players’ performances.  Ben was too busy laying up at the driving range trying to impress email pen pals to realize that OBJ wasn’t playing but was in his starting line up, scoring just as much as Ben.</li><br />
							<li>Danny (-):  The week started promising for Danny, as he pulled out to a 58 point lead on Thursday against Isaac.  However, as the preseason power rankings predicted, the rest of Danny’s team was awful, and there was a lot of choking involved as Danny turned a 58 point lead into a 38 point defeat by the end of the weekend.  A goose egg from Gesicki, and less than 8 points from Saquon and Julio combined gave Danny the 3rd lowest score of the week where he sits comfortably in 8th place as predicted.</li><br />
							<li>Debellis (-2):  Debellis made the terd look semi-competent this week, failing to break 90 and being the only non-terd to fail to break 100.  Deandre Swift was his only player to beat projections, with only ⅓ of his players even scoring double digits.  Even his bench did not fare much better.  At this rate, Debellis has an uphill battle to even think about making the Adam bowl this year.</li><br />
							<li>Guff (-):  The terd lived up (or down) to expectations this week, failing to break 100 points while leaving a bunch of points on his bench.  His 1st round pick, rookie RB Najee Harris contributed a monstrous 5.4 points, which was far from his worst player.  Aaron Rodgers scored a mind blowing 1.32 points while Aiyuk was the star of the day with his 7 return yards, or 0.14 points.  Yahoo hit the nail on the head with their 0-14 draft day projection for this dumpster fire.</li><br />
						</ol>

						<header>
							<h2>WEEK 2 POWER RANKINGS:</h2>
							<h3>1. That guy’s bellybutton 2. Your dong</h3>
						</header>

						<ol type="1">
							<li>Isaac (-):  After crushing the competition with ease in week 1 and scoring the most points of the week, Isaac decided to challenge himself in week 2 and win with the lowest amount of points needed.  TJ Hockenson continued to be a happy little accident while Mike Williams might be the greatest WR of all time.  Through 2 weeks, Isaac has had the highest and lowest winning scores.  Who knows how he will show his excellence next week?</li><br />
							<li>Dac (+3):  Dac balled out this week, scoring 170 points and taking the season record from Isaac.  Cooper Kupp once again was amazing and is now averaging over 28 points a week.  Joe Mixon crashed back down to earth, as expected, but the brilliant pick up of the Tampa Bay defense and their 25 points more than made up for whatever minor shortcomings Dac’s team had this week.</li><br />
							<li>Donch (+3):  Similar to last week, Kelce and Lockett put up huge performances as Donch scored the second highest total of the week in his beatdown of the terd.  Donch has found great value in Brandin Cooks, who is averaging 18 points through the first 2 weeks.  It was a rough week for his QB, but there’s no point in wasting a good QB week on the terd.</li><br />
							<li>JC (-2): JC had a rough go of it this week as he faced a weekly league high 170 points from Dac.  Once again, Kyler had an insane week, putting up 39 points while Aaron Jones added another 39.  Those two alone combined for 63% of JC’s points, while CeeDee Lamb was the only other player even in double digits, and just barely at that.  JC will have a tough matchup against Isaac’s undefeated team, but he can at least sleep peacefully knowing he’s the cream of the crop in the horrendously dumpy D1.</li><br />
							<li>Davies (-1): It was a disappointing week for Davies, losing to Danny after such a strong showing vs. Donch last week.  Tyreek Hill only scored 4 points, while Myles Gaskin only added 7 more.  Without a fantastic week by Scary Terry, Davies could’ve joined Matt in the sub 100 group.  Davies will need a bounce back game next week vs. Ben, which at the rate things are going, shouldn’t be too difficult.</li><br />
							<li>Debellis (+3):  After putting up the lowest score of the week last week, Debellis mildly redeemed himself with a respectable 143 points, good for third highest of the week.  Boosted by a classic 47 point Derrick Henry game, Debellis was able to hide a disappointing game from CEH.  Debellis doesn’t have the depth or star power to put up these scores regularly, but Derrick Henry is gamechanger enough to potentially will Debellis to a .500 record.</li><br />
							<li>Danny (+1):  Old man Brady and his 40 point week carried Danny to victory this week.  The first victory is always the hardest for Danny and the fact it came week 2 this year means we might have a new RST for once.  Could this be the year Danny finally makes a deep playoff run?  Or will all his players get sick and die, fate clawing him back to his rightful place in the dumps?</li><br />
							<li>Matt (-5):  Matt’s team dropped off a cliff this week, being the only team to not break 100.  If Matt got a point for every mile he biked on Sunday he would’ve beaten his fantasy team by 20 points.  It’s a good thing Matt finished his Iron Man this weekend so that he at least has one thing to be proud of.</li><br />
							<li>DBen (-2):  The good news is Ben started all players this week who were actually playing.  The bad news is it didn’t make a difference.  In a puzzling move, Ben benched his first round pick, Ezekiel Elliot, for Elijah Mitchell and/or Melvin Gordon which cost him 10 points that could’ve made this loss less embarrassing.  BBB also blew his entire budget for Elijah Mitchell which could not have gone worse.  At this point in the season, the only thing Ben has to be thankful for is the existence of Guff.</li><br />
							<li>Guff (-):  Guff really stepped it up this week after last week’s disappointing showing.  Stepping it up to Guff is breaking 100 and losing by 25 points, but the effort should at least be acknowledged.  Guff made almost all of the correct managerial moves, had his opponent’s QB score 7 points, and this was never even competitive.  It’s not certain if it can get worse from 0-2 and lowest points for, but Guff will try his hardest to see what rock bottom he can find next week.</li><br />
						</ol>
						
						<header>
							<h2>WEEK 3 POWER RANKINGS:</h2>
							<h3>I am now walking alone in the night.</h3>
						</header>

						<ol type="1">
							<li>Isaac (-):  Isaac’s perfect start to the season continued as he took home the weekly top score (for the second time in 3 weeks) and the biggest blowout, confirming the naked truth that he is the greatest.  Minus the whole “losing first overall pick CMC in the first quarter for multiple weeks” thing, Isaac didn’t have much to complain about.  Josh Allen finally came to life with a 45 point performance, best WR ever Mike Williams added 31, and RB KHunt kicked JC’s lifeless squad when they were down with 25 points of his own.  The 3 aforementioned players could’ve beaten JC’s team on their own.</li><br />
							<li>Dac (-):  After two spectacular weeks to start the season, Dac suffered an embarrassing defeat to perennial RST and D1 black sheep Danny.  Cooper Kupp tallied 26 points this week, making him the surprising #1 WR thus far, but it wasn’t enough as 5 of Dac’s 9 players were in single digits, and he struggled to break 100.  The Tampa Bay defense contributed a cool 0 points as Dac was outscored 23-0 in the matchup on defense.  Dac appears to be stashing every IR WR in the league, and if any of those pay off down the road, Dac could make a deep playoff run.</li><br />
							<li>Donch (-):  Donch snuck out a close one against Matt this week, thanks to some last minute heroics by Dak Prescott.  Donch’s core group of studs played well, with the exception Tyler Lockett finally reverting back to the 30 or 5 pt weeks he rotated between last season, with this week being the 5 pt one.  Benching Jim Rob and his 22 points was a head scratcher, but thankfully one Donch won’t have to beat himself up over this week.</li><br />
							<li>Davies (+1):  Davies faced spiraling Ben this week and managed a real (not fake) come from behind victory.  Thanks to Matt Stafford’s 38 points, Davies took a big lead into Monday night which he would not relinquish, despite Ezekiel Elliot’s best efforts.  Of Nick Chubb’s projected 16 points, he scored about half, which turned out to be the margin of victory for Davies this week.  As if the loss wasn’t enough for Ben, it was the second time this week he was defeated by a half Chubb.</li><br />
							<li>Debellis (+1):  Debellis strung together his second 140+ point week in a row, easily waltzing past the current and odds on favorite future terd.  Apart from Rondale Moore, Debellis had a strong showing from his entire squad, all scoring double digits.  His bench was utter trash, but barring any significant injuries, Debellis may have righted the ship and proved he can once again go .500 this year.</li><br />
							<li>Danny (+1):  Danny picked up his 2nd win of the season, in week 3, for the first time in league history.  Tom Brady continues to be the ageless wonder, carrying Danny’s team, while Davante Adams is still on an impressive scoring streak from last year.  Whether out of necessity or just being bad at fantasy football, Danny started a lot of duds this week, as James White, Jared Cook, and Q. Cephus (huh?) combined for 5.6 points.  Danny may not have many points for, but he has wins, and that’s all that counts.</li><br />
							<li>JC (-3):  JC’s team crashed and burned this week in a surprising slaughter at the hands of Isaac.  Kyler Murray went from averaging over 40 points a game to not even throwing a passing TD.  Miles Sanders is the least runny RB in the history of the NFL, and AJ Brown got hurt early and will likely miss some time; however, that was karmic justice for the CMC injury Isaac suffered.  The only bright spot for JC this week was Antonio Gibson’s 19 points, granted 84% of Gibson’s points and 16% of JC’s total points came from one play.</li><br />
							<li>Matt (-):  Matt suffered a narrow defeat at the hands of Donch this week, losing by <5 points and penciling in his spot for the heartbreak loss.  With only 2 of Matt’s players beating projections, Dallas Goedert and the Arizona Defense, it’s a miracle Matt was ever even in this game to begin with.  Things are starting to look troubling for Matt, as his weak bench and underperforming studs seem destined for another spell in the dumps.</li><br />
							<li>Ben (-):  Ben’s team has gone completely limp this season, starting off an awful 0-3.  His team simply cannot perform under pressure, and they go soft in the face of the slightest adversity.  Ezekiel Elliot was the top performer for Ben this week, but his 25 points was just enough to get kind of close to victory but not the full way to completion.  As the league advances to the climax of the season, Ben’s best bet is to just fake it til he makes it and hope that it’s enough to at least not end up the terd.</li><br />
							<li>Guff (-):  The terd continued his journey to 0-14, getting demolished by Debellis.  Ja’Marr Chase was inexplicably left on the bench for the 3rd week in a row, where he casually scored 21 points, becoming the 4th best WR of the season, yet failing to ever crack a starting line up.  That was not the only managerial blunder of the week for Guff, as his “RB1s” David Montgomery and Ty’Son Williams combined for almost 9 points, while whatever RB# Javonte Williams,  Nyheim Hines, and Sony Michel are each beat Guff’s flexed RB1 pair on their own.  The only silver lining this week was his ability to break 100, barely.</li><br />
