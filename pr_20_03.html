							<h2>WEEK 3 POWER RANKINGS</h2>
							<h3>“You're LOSIN”</h3>
						</header>

						<ol type="1">
							<li>Isaac (+1):  Isaac posted the high score of the season this week, and was only a moderately competent QB away from setting a league history high.  Despite not having a QB break 19 points yet this year, Isaac is only 2.5 points short of most points for.  Accolades and praise aside, this may be the peak for Isaac as a mysterious injury has potentially sidelined the league’s top WR, and Isaac is the proud owner of a first round rona casualty.  At least starting the season 3-0 got Isaac more wins than he’s used to in a season.</li><br />
							<li>Debellis (-1):  Dark horse Debellis kept up the momentum this week demolishing le Guff.  Debellis has a great starting line up, but less depth than any of Ben’s hot takes.  To further compound those issues, he may be out 2 of his top players, as Godwin and Carson both are unlikely to play.  If there’s any silver lining, it’s that Debellis plays Ben this week and should continue his win streak even if half his team gets injured.  He can probably even pull another bone head move like starting -1 point NO defense against Green Bay and still win. </li><br />
							<li>Dac (+1):  Dac is looking more and more likely to be the first repeat champion.  He’s top scorer in the league, and he has superstars at every position.  Russell Wilson is averaging 43 points a week, the starting Carolina RB  23 pts a week, and Hopkins 19 pts a week.  Dac will face his stiffest challenge yet, as he faces high flying Isaac this week.  At this point, either Dac will take down Isaac or the injury and rona bugs will.</li><br />
							<li>Davies (+1):  Davies did the impossible and started the correct line up this week and has the victory and boost in the power rankings to show for it.  Granted, this week a third of his bench was hurt which made starter selection easier, and he faced off against king of the dumps, Ben, but in these uncertain times little victories matter too.  Davies has possibly the deepest team right now, which will be invaluable as players have been dropping faster than glasses at Danny’s wedding. </li><br />
							<li>Matt (+2):  Matt continued his impressive season this week with a win over previously undefeated Donch.  Alvin Kamara is quite possibly the greatest fantasy player ever, as he somehow manages to score more points every week despite the previous week being amazing to begin with.  Between Matt’s strong roster of Kamara + random other guys who score 15-20 pts a week and the existence of Danny, Guff, and Ben, Matt can sleep safely knowing he won’t be the first repeat terd.</li><br />
							<li>Donch (-3):  Donch suffered his first loss of the season at the hands of current Terd Matt.  Donch had some hope going into Sunday, but that was quickly extinguished as Kamara curb stomped Donch’s entire team.  Instead of getting garbage time points, Jared Cook just was straight garbage.  Donch’s team has been showing some cracks in recent weeks, and a week 4 matchup against the solid yet unlucky JC could change the course of Donch’s season.</li><br />
							<li>JC (-1):  JC’s bad luck continued this week as he ran into Isaac the juggernaut.  He would’ve beaten most teams this week, but the scheduling was not in his favor.  Josh Allen continues to be the steal of the draft, with DK Metcalf not being far behind.  JC should breeze to the playoffs courtesy of D1 weakness, and if he can fix his Joe Mixon issue, he could make a respectable playoff run.</li><br />
							<li>Danny (-):  Danny, in his infinite wisdom, decided to bench Deshaun Watson for Minshew 2 this week.  As everyone predicted, that turned out to be a horrible move, as Watson more than doubled Minshew’s paltry 9 points this week.  In the end, it didn’t even come close to mattering as Danny’s team STINKS, didn’t break 100, and lost by 40.  At this point, one almost has to question if Danny is intentionally the worst fantasy manager of all time.</li><br />
							<li>Guff (-):  Guff’s woes continue, as he became the third manager to not break 100 this season.  Outside of Jrob, there wasn’t a bright spot this week.  Lamar has been figured out and had the worst game of his career.  No one else on Guff’s team even bothered to hit double figures.  If Guff wants to get a win this season, he better trade in the baguettes and red wine for buffalo wings and bud heavies.  Or just wait til he plays Danny.  Either will work.</li><br />
							<li>Ben (-):  Ben continues to trot out the worst fantasy team of all time, eclipsing 100 points for the first time this season, and just barely at that.  Mahomes had almost 50% of Ben’s 105 points, which is double M. Jones Jr, M. Williams, M. Ingram II, L. Fournette, J. Reed, and D. Montgomery COMBINED.  Ben’s only chance at victory this year is facing a team as injured as Ben perpetually is.</li><br />
