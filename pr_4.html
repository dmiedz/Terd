							<h2>WEEK 4 POWER RANKINGS</h2>
							<h3>ARE THESE REAL NAMES</h3>
						</header>

						<ol type="1">
							<li> Debellis (+1):  Debellis has quietly put together an undefeated season through week 4, despite barely being in the top half of the league in points scored.  His opponents the last 3 weeks are currently a combined 0-12, and Debellis’ points against shows that very clearly.  It’s too early to tell if his team is good or just lucky, but to his credit, even winning a wrestling match against a girl still counts as a win.</li><br />
							<li>Davies (+2):  Davies had another massive week, throttling lowly Danny.  It was a waste of a week as he could have scored 40 less points and still won.  He’s finally figured out his QB situation, but is a Raheem Mostert return away from having to make some tricky managerial lineup decisions.  At any rate, it won’t matter because Davies has a cake walk to the D1 bye as the only threatening team.</li><br />
							<li>Dac (-):  Dac had his worst game of the season this week, which was still a respectable 122 points.  He could’ve had a way worse week and still easily beat Isaac.  Just as everyone suspected, Mike Davis continued scoring 20 pts a week, while Melvin Gordon picked up about 93 points on the garbagiest garbage time run of all time.  However, most impressive was Dac owning 3 bench players who all scored 20 points.</li><br />
							<li>Isaac (-3):  Isaac had a rough week to put it lightly.  He picked up a “hot” QB who promptly had a trash week for the 4th week in a row, bringing his weekly QB average to 15.2 points.  Additionally, his star RB Derrick Henry got Rona’ed.  His top WR, and league top WR at that, put up a goose egg, while his second best WR, and league second best WR, contributed a cool 4.9 points.  Incredibly, both are still ranked first and second in the league.  On the plus side, Isaac plays 0-4 Ben this week, but on the negative side, Isaac’s Rona RB is now starting to take down the rest of his team as collateral damage.</li><br />
							<li>Matt (-):  Matt continued his strong season with an impressive victory over Guff.  Dak continues his REALLY LONG REALLY LUCKY streak, while the rest of Matt’s team ain’t too shabby either.  Matt will have his toughest test of the season, as he plays fellow Baltimore Bro, and unstoppable force, Dac.</li><br />
							<li>JC (+1):  JC came in hot this with the beat down of the season.  Week 4 was his last week before becoming a biological father, but Donch now has to call him dad as well.  Josh Allen continues to be fantastic, and Joe Mixon had the game of his life.  Inconsistency and bad luck will be what determines whether JC sneaks into playoffs or gets pulled into the dumps.</li><br />
							<li>Donch (-1):  Oh no baby what is you doin’? Donch has been in a steady free fall the past two weeks, and there is no end in sight.  Actually there is an end in sight.  It’s whenever he gets to play Danny, Guff, or Ben.</li><br />
							<li>Danny (-):  It has now been 675 days since Danny’s last regular season win.  At this point, the Danny winless jokes are like beating a dead horse.  To really visualize the impressive streak Danny is on, each of the following zeros represents a day Danny has lived on God’s green earth since his last regular season win.  000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000</li><br />
							<li>Guff (-):  Ol’ Frenchy had his best week of the season, but he still got truck sticked by current Terd and 2nd worst in D2 Matt.  Guff managed to waste CD Lamb and OBJ’s best games ever and Lamar Jackson remembering how to play football.  This upcoming week is a lose lose for Guff.  He either gets a pity victory against Danny, or is responsible for ending Danny’s 675 day and counting losing streak.</li><br />
							<li>Ben (-):  Ben has now broken 100 two weeks in a row, which in his case, is cause for celebration.  At this rate, Ben might be able to break 135 by week 11.  Ben’s best chance so far for a victory comes this week, as all of his opponent’s good players are on real byes or rona byes.  So far this year, despite purchasing a Hitachi magic wand, the only good vibes Ben is giving out is to his league mates via free wins.</li><br />
