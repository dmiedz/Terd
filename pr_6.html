							<h2>WEEK 6 POWER RANKINGS</h2>
							<h3>Don’t expect much but it feeds the family</h3>
						</header>

						<ol type="1">
							<li>Debellis (-):  Debellis faced his first opponent since week 1 who was able to score more than 109 points.  As the 6th most potent offense, it is not surprising he lost.  It would appear that Debellis’ fortunate stretch of easy schedule has ended.  His first 6 weeks of opponents are currently 13-23 while his remaining 7 weeks of opponents are 25-17.  Now is the time for Debellis to prove whether his long stay at the top of the power rankings was deserved or just good timing.</li><br />
							<li>Dac (-):  Marred by injury, byes, and DUIs,  Dac had his worst week by a large margin, even though Russell replacement Tannehill chipped in a cool 37 points.  In all honesty, Dac wins this week 9/10 times.  If Derrick Henry had only scored 34.95 points, Dac would be comfortably sitting in first.  Dac started his week confidently posting pictures of his championship belt and ended the week with Derrick Henry spanking him with a belt.</li><br />
							<li>JC (+1):  JC had an uneventful week, coasting by Donch without a worry in the world.  JC didn’t even bother to score 120 points, knowing full well just cracking 100 would give him 90% odds to beach Donch.  JC made some moves this week and time will tell if they will backfire and he’ll fall backwards into first place in D1, or they will prove genius and he’ll steamroll to first place in D1.</li><br />
							<li>Isaac (+1):  In fantasy football it is common for a player or two to carry the rest of the team in their backpack, and then there is whatever Derrick Henry did this week.  Apart from Henry, there was nothing good about Isaac’s week.  He got a 50 point RB performance and barely broke 120.  Only two players exceeded projections - Ridley by 1.5 points and Henry by 30.  Isaac’s week 7 matchup will be a coin toss against the other most inconsistent team in the league, Davies.</li><br />
							<li>Matt (+1):  Matt had the ultimate WR week as JJJJ combined for 69 points.  Nice.  It was more than enough to take down previous and current top ranked Debellis, who to the surprise of no one finally lost after having to face a semi competent opponent.  Clearly motivated to avoid repeat Terd status, Matt is having a great season and is a matchup away from either becoming Danny’s latest victim or a lock for playoffs.</li><br />
							<li>Davies (-3):  Davies was the big loser of the week putting up an abysmal 62 point performance.  He was a poor Arizona defensive performance away from setting the league record all time low.  The aforementioned defense was the only player to exceed projections, with only one other player even reaching double digits.  The dynamic foursome of Aaron Rodgers, Mike Evans, Tyreek Hill, and Kareem Hunt COMBINED for 16 points.  Assuming all of Davies’ players decided to have their worst week the same week, he could be due for a 300 points performance this weekend.</li><br />
							<li>Danny (+1):  What’s the temperature because HOT DANNY has arrived?  After going 675+ days without a regular season win, Danny has now racked up TWO wins in just 8 days.  He’s only a matchup away with the current Terd from turning that into a 3 game win streak and potentially becoming a D1 contender or cementing his pretender status.</li><br />
							<li>Donch (-1):  Donch is now averaging just 96 points over the past 3 weeks, proving this might be the new normal and not an unlucky streak.  Even that 96 point average is generous as 20% of Donch’s weekly total comes in the gabargiest of all garbage time.  At this point, the best Donch can hope for on a weekly basis is for someone on his team to go off so he can break 100.</li><br />
							<li>Guff (+1):  Guff got his first victory of the year, and a 52 point victory at that.  That being said, he barely scored 114 points, 1 point above the average losing score.  Sometimes it is better to be lucky than good, and this week, Guff nailed the lucky part, as his opponent put up the lowest score in years.  Expect Guff to revert back to his roots as a week 7 matchup with Dac should have Guff failing at both being lucky and being good.</li><br />
							<li>Ben (-1):  Ben followed up his big win last week with a loss to fellow dumper Danny.  Ben had a great week by his standards, but unfortunately didn’t have Mike Williams this week to miraculously get him 30 points for the victory.  Like his 2020 love life, Ben’s team is trending in the right direction despite having no hope for near term success.</li><br />
