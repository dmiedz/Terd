							<h2>WEEK 5 POWER RANKINGS</h2>
							<h3>Calm as a cucumber bb</h3>
						</header>

						<ol type="1">
							<li>Debellis (-):  Debellis’ incredible streak of playing the worst teams at their worst continued another week as he took on the floundering Donch.  Other than Donch, Debellis could’ve only beaten one other team this week.  Debellis’ team is consistently average enough to beat up on the dumps, and even though his playoff spot is all but assured at this point, it’ll be a short run.</li><br />
							<li>Dac (+1):  Dac continued his 4 game win streak, with his only loss (Week 1) coming by 0.26 points to what can now confidently be described as a lucky and one off overperforming Debellis team.  The scary thing about Dac’s team is that he’s been doing all this without CMC.  Dac’s only other foreseeable D2 loss could come this week, as he is without team leader Russell Wilson against Isaac’s wildly inconsistent team.</li><br />
							<li>Davies (-1):  Davies came out the big loser this week in the battle of the D1 heavyweights aka only weights.  For this loss, Davies only has himself to blame.  His decision to start Scary Terry with Kyle Allen at QB over the fastest guy ever Raheem Mostert at least can be somewhat defended.  His decision to start Austin Pooper over Jonnu Smith is entirely indefensible, and in the end it is the reason why Davies is not 2 games ahead for the D1 bye.</li><br />
							<li>JC (+2):  In this week’s dad battle, new dad JC spanked old Davies.  It came down to Tuesday night, as Davies watched Jonnu Smith accumulate points on his bench and JC watched all his WRs put up buku points in his starting line up.  As of now, JC’s only chance of not making playoffs is if somehow all of D2 does.</li><br />
							<li>Isaac (-1):  Isaac had a heartbreaking defeat to previously winless Ben this week, even though Isaac finally got the good QB performance he’s been craving all year.  Unfortunately for Isaac, all of those points and more went straight to Ben’s receiver on the same team, including a 15 point garbage time play on the worst coverage in the history of the NFL.  The real let down of the week for Isaac was Devin Singletary, who apparently was named after his uncanny ability to gain 1 singletary yard every time he touches the ball.</li><br />
							<li>Matt (-1):  Matt’s season took a nosedive this week as Dak, Matt’s team’s crown jewel, borrowed Adam’s ankles which were promptly snapped in half.  Instead of getting a guaranteed 40 points a week, Matt now gets to join the group of streamers battling over Joe Burrow, Gardner Minshew, and Ryan Tannehill each week.  In just 5 short weeks, Matt’s outlook has gone from terd to first to terd.</li><br />
							<li>Donch (-):  In the most baffling trend of the season thus far, Donch went from a respectable and successful team to one that is currently fast tracking to the Terd bowl.  After 89 points last week and only 98 points this week, all of the once promising players on Donch’s team are now on his opponents’ teams.  It’s one thing to shoot yourself in the foot; it’s another thing to shotgun blast both of your own knee caps off.</li><br />
							<li>Danny (-):  Miracle on ice, 16 seed UMBC, Appalachian State, and now Danny winning a regular season fantasy game complete the Mount Rushmore of greatest sports upsets in the history of the world.  Could this be the start of a new, prosperous chapter for Danny?  Or is this the epitome of a blind squirrel finding a nut?  We only have to wait 3 days to find out.</li><br />
							<li>Ben (+1):  Ben may have been shut down in the bed room last weekend, but for once this year, his team picked up his slack in the scoring department.  Over half of Ben’s skill positions scored TDs, with 2 of them scoring multiple.  On top of that, Mahomes chipped in his usual 30+ points.  Like 2015, this fantasy year will end in lackluster fashion for Ben, but he will have his one win to look back on fondly for years.</li><br />
						</ol>
						<ul>
							<li>NR: Guff (-∞):  In a league where Danny has gone years without a win, Danny has scored less than 35 points (adjusted for inflation), Ben has lost 5 championships scoring sub 70 points, Griff started Kevin Kolb intentionally, and Adam drafted Matt Schaub in the 7th, Guff had the most shameful performance in league history this week.  Imagine losing to a guy who up until last week, hadn’t recorded a victory in Jack Davies’ entire life.  Going into this week’s matchup, Guff’s odds were -100000 because what idiot could possibly lose to a guy on an almost 700 day losing streak.  Matt dreams of betting $10K to win a nickel on these odds.  This is what Guff accomplished this week and let us #neverforget.  Hey France, you can keep him.</li><br />
