							<h2>WEEK 10 POWER RANKINGS</h2>
							<h3>And she wasn't kidding</h3>
						</header>

						<ol type="1">
							<li>Debellis (+3): This was a super predictable week for Debellis as he hit his sweet spot of 116 points for and less than 100 against.  With both of his starting RBs on bye, Debellis pulled a Donch and got more than respectable efforts out of his back ups.  At WR, Debellis was less fortunate, as two of his best both sat on the bench.  Debellis has a week 11 matchup against Isaac, who is seemingly incapable of scoring points, as his only obstacle between all but securing the D2 bye</li><br />
							<li>Dac (-1):  It’s unfair to say, but Dac had an awful week even though 33% of his team scored over 20 points.  With Kelce on bye and Russell Wilson forgetting how to play football, the week didn’t get off to a promising start.  If there was any consolation to his second worst week of the year, it’s that DHOP had probably the greatest catch in years.</li><br />
							<li> Davies (+2):  Davies’ hot streak continued this week as he flushed the Terd.  Granted everyone sucked this week, but Davies was only a fraction of a point away from his 3rd consecutive weekly high score.  Outside of JK Dobbins, a super dumpy Ohio State RB, Davies' team was respectable across the board.  With Jonnu Smith deciding he’s a goal line RB now and vulturing TDs from Derrick Henry, and Tyreek Hill coming back from bye, Davies is the one team no one should currently want to face.</li><br />
							<li>JC (-2):  JC became Ben’s second victim of the year as his stable of superstar WRs were completely worthless.  Metcalf, Brown, and Thomas combined for 10 points.  JC will see better days, especially in the uncompetitive D1, but it never feels good to lose to the RST.</li><br />
							<li> Isaac (-2):  Isaac’s team is in a complete freefall, failing to break 100 for the 3rd straight week, and failing to even break 90 this week.  Across two weeks, his skill players have combined for just 1 touchdown (thanks Evan Engram) and an individual high score of 13 points (thanks Evan Engram).  The only thing that Isaac has going for him at this point is that Ben’s team exists.</li><br />
							<li>Matt (-):  Matt suffered another loss pushing him closer to the terrifying dumps and keeping a repeat Terd in the cards.  Having his QB Brees leave the game early certainly didn’t help his cause, but he was pretty comfortably hedged as the Saints just let Kamara do everything which was evidenced by his 31 points.  Matt needs a couple more wins to safely rule out repeat Terdom.</li><br />
							<li>Donch (-):  Donch took home his second weekly high score.  Ignoring the fact it was the lowest high score of the year by 20 points, and Donch is the proud owner of 2 out of the 3 lowest weekly high scores, it was a good week.  The BDE move of the week was confidently trotting out Tom Brady on back of a 2 pt performance.  The move paid off handsomely, as Donch took down one of the league front runners, Dac, despite starting Zack Moss over Nyheim Hines.</li><br />
							<li>Guff (-):  Guff survived his Pat Mahomes bye week with an improbable and undeserved 92 point victory, the lowest winning score of the season.  Deandre Swift and Stephon Diggs both had their second best games of the year which was enough for Guff to secure the victory.  Those two alone scored more points than 50% of Isaac’s team’s total.  If there was ever a game no one deserved to win, it was this one.</li><br />
							<li>Danny (-1):  The bad news is Danny owns the longest active losing streak.  The good news is it’s 10 games shorter than last year’s longest active losing streak.  Cancel hot Danny cause he hasn’t broken 100 in almost a month.  In pure Danny fashion, he benched Rojo, who not only would’ve been his best RB, but would’ve been his highest scoring player even including QB!  Based on his bench, if Danny was a good manager he could’ve won, but he’s not, and no one should ever think differently.</li><br />
							<li>Ben (-):  After two weeks of losing specifically because of his bonehead trade, Ben won this week specifically because of it.  The main factor in all of this was that Pat Mahomes was on a bye week so it really doesn’t count.  Regardless, a win is a win, as Ben got lucky enough to have 2 of his players have good weeks at the same time.  On top of that, his mediocre players slightly outperformed JC’s good players’ bad weeks which gave him a comfortable margin of victory.</li><br />
